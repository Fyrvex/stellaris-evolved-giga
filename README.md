# Stellaris Evolved - Gigastructures Patch

## Changes and Additions

- Adjusted all gigastructures districts to provide support for evolved mechanics, civics, traditions and what not.
- Support for evolved deposits and new planet types for frameworld outposts.
- Elysium host capitals and buildings have support for evolved civics and ethics, for new assembly types and ascension paths. All assembly types will be provided on the host planet when unlocked, so disable the assmebly jobs that are not used.
- Birch world origin should have some support for evolved civics and ethics, feedback is needed.
